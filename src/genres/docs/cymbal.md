### Splash Cymbal

- Accent (same purpose but smaller than crash)
- 4" 6" & 8" ...up to 12"
- Higher pitch & faster decay
- e.g. mounted on top of crash (more than one stackable)

### Bell Cymbal

- e.g. use shaft of stick for aggressive sound

### Ride Cymbal

- 20", 21" & 22" (larger e.g. 24" or 26" are rare)
- Slow decay (keeps it ringing = "the wash" preferences: loud or dry wash)
- 18" & 20" highgrids (crash-rides)
- Jazz often crashes the ride
