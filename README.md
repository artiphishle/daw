## Vision

### Free & open-source

This platform will be free to use for everyone, and it will be open-source. Of course we'd like to offer you additional services that could come with a price tag, but the core of the platform will always be free.

### Compose, arrange, record, mix & master

Yeah. It's a DAW, right?

### Intuitive & AI supported workflow

The platform will help you while you're working on your project. E.g. you can turn on rules that will warn you if you are out of tune, or transpose your music to a different key. You can also tune the instruments to Verdi's A4 (432Hz) with one simple click if you like to.

There will be tons of free samples, grouped by tons of genres, there will be live workshops while you're creating your next hit. You can also collaborate with other musicians, share events and much more.

### Vision: eLearning

#### Audio-Engineer

You will learn how to master the art of mixing, there will be many chapters with different topics, like: Harmonic EQ'ing, Psycho Acoustic, New York Compression, Cambridge HPF, etc.

_**Did you know?** The SM57 & SM58 live microphones mainly used for vocals on live concerts sound great to record an electical guitar! The SM57 will give you a more direct sound, the SM58 sounds more airy instead._

#### Learn to play an instrument

You will learn how to play an instrument, the better you become the more influence in the online community you will learn build & maintain. You will learn about existing playing styles, and there will be exercises like online games to play with other musicians.

#### (Game-) Sound Design

You will learn how to compose sound to movies/game and how to create sound from scratch. This includes Foley and orchestration, how to design emotion for the listener and plan your project like a pro.

Did you know? If you press `E` & `F` on your piano in all octaves fast and furious, you can see Tom haunting Jerry. If you play them upwards (EF EF EF EF) it will increase the tension, vice verca Tom has already resigned catching that Meow!
